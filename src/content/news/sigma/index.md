title: "Sigma boy"
summary: "Sigma Males are often described as lone wolfs who are able to stand alone, being confident and not letting their emotions define them. They typically appear stoic, calm, and are not controlled by others. They also have good leadership skills. Sigma Males are also typically intelligent and charismatic. They are also said to have success with women, which is the difference between sigmas and alphas. They are not desperate and don't go out of their way to impress others. They also don't need external validation."
